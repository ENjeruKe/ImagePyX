ImagePyX and SSWIMM
===================

This is a Super Simple WIM Manager written entirely in Python[*] (except for the compression code, found at
https://github.com/coderforlife/ms-compress: please note that only XPRESS compression works well, actually).

With ImagePyX you can:
- capture a directory tree to a WIM Image, eventually compressing it and excluding files/folders
- update or delete an image inside a WIM
- append new images to a WIM
- apply (extract) an image from WIM unit to a directory, optionally excluding files/folders
- split a WIM into more SWM units
- export an image to a new WIM
- list and test image contents
